        Our most recent video, shot recently by ourselves of our mobile
        DJs at weddings and other events around <?php echo $regions[$_GET['region']]["associated_areas"]; ?> and beyond. 
        Check out more videos and up to date feeds of what we are doing on our Facebook page and other social media links below. We also have a blog that you can find on the link above.

        Anything from a small party to a festival we can supply DJs for. Leeds City Council have used us in the past for events in Millenium Square and we are suppliers to large festivals.
        Whatever the event, we treat it with professionalism. About the only thing we don't do are children's parties.
