  <p class="lead">We cover all forms of bar bookings, from one off promotions, christmas parties, through to monthly and weekly nights.</p>
  <p class="clearfix">Prices depend on the night of the week, times, whether we are supplying PA / lighting, whether it is a one off or ongoing night etc. What I always suggest is meeting you in the venue to discuss your needs. I will then monitor how things are progressing, feeding back information to DJs.</p>
